# Method of Characteristics for designing supersonic nozzles.

The code utilizes method of characterisitics to solve the velocity potential equation (which is a hyperbolic partial differential equation) used for modelling compressible, inviscid and irrotational fluid flow.

# Results

Figures attached below demonstrate the progression of the nozzle contour for required exit Mach number of '2' with adiabatic gas constant of 1.4. As the number of characteristic curves are increased, the contour becomes smoother and more accurate.
